#What is Sneef?
Sneef is a stats-tracking algorithm that tracks gameplay of the game, DotA2, via valve's web api. Sneef tilizes Meteor, CoffeeScript, Jade, and Stylus for development, and Clarity for data generation.

##How is sneef different from services like DotABuff?
Sneef Focuses more on individual games and player roles, rather than gameplay-over-time charts. Roles can be dictated per account or per game, and follow typical team role norms for data analysis.
